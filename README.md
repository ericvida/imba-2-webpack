Official site for Imba. Work in progress.

## Run
```
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/imba/imba.io

# enter the folder
cd imba.io

# install dependencies
npm install

# package content from content/ (continously)
npm run watch-content

# run server
npm start
```

Because the site uses service workers it requires https: with a trusted certificate.
To test things in development you need to do it via Chrome launched with specific args:

```bash
open -na Google\ Chrome --args --ignore-certificate-errors --unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure=https://localhost
# if this does not work - try
# /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --ignore-certificate-errors --unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure=https://localhost
```

Now visit https://localhost:9000/ in that browser
